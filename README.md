> üìù A hackable HackMD desktop application

> [!WARNING]
> This project is actively under development, so expect some bugs & missing features.

## Introduction

### üìö Docs: <https://hackdesk.eastsun.me>

HackDesk is an unofficial desktop application for HackMD, powered by [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). It serves as a lightweight wrapper for [hackmd.io](http://hackmd.io). So, you'll find everything you love about HackMD and some additional features ‚ú®.

Thanks to Tauri utilizing the OS's native WebView, the bundle size remains [small](https://tauri.app/v1/references/benchmarks#binary-size), and it's memory-efficient. Please keep in mind that this project is actively under development, so expect some bugs & missing features.

You should also check out the official Electron-based [HackMD desktop app](https://github.com/hackmdio/hackmd-desktop), along with some extra features inspired by the [HackMD Raycast extension](https://www.raycast.com/Yukai/hackmd) and [hackbar](https://github.com/uier/hackbar).

This project was largely inspired by [ChatGPT](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT) üôè.

And you can also follow me on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@EastSun5566) üòé
