> üìù An unofficial HackMD desktop app powered

## Introduction

HackDesk is an unofficial desktop application for HackMD, powered by [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). It serves as a lightweight wrapper for [hackmd.io](http://hackmd.io). So, you'll find everything you love about HackMD, and some additional features.

Thanks to Tauri utilizing the OS's native webview, the bundle size remains small, and it's memory-efficient. Please keep in mind that this project is actively under development, so expect some bugs & missing features.

You should also checkout official Electron-based [HackMD desktop app](https://github.com/hackmdio/hackmd-desktop), along with some extra features inspired by the [HackMD Raycast extension](https://www.raycast.com/Yukai/hackmd) and [hackbar](https://github.com/uier/hackbar).

This project was largely inspired by [ChatGPT](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT) and [WA+](https://github.com/lencx/WA). Special thanks to [@lencx](https://github.com/lencx).
